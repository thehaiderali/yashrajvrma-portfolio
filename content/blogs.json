It sounds bad but reality is that these LLMS have destroyed that the integrity of online platforms like X (Twitter), Reddit,Linked etc. Whenever you open one of these platforms you see the same patterns of AI generated bloat by people .

So if \"You\" are that stranger. I really appreciate your presence here and stay tuned for some interesting stuff.</p>\n<p>see you soon again .</p>",
